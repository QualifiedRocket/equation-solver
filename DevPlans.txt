This is a list of all of the features to implement into the Equation Solver project.

    Required steps to implement:
        Gather information:
            Ask what type of equation to answer
            User enters equation
 
        Sort information:
            Determine degree of equation, d
            Create containers for each value, starting d-n
                Array of arrays? [ax^d][bx^d-1][cx^d-2]...[px^0][q]
            Store data as a "history" to call upon later?
 
        Gather more information:
            Ask to either solve for input y value, or factor
            Start with implementing single variable x, move on to implementing multi-variable functions later
 
        For input y, just do basic calculations and return
 
        For factoring:
            Start with common factors, both numerically and with x
            Remove common x first
            Test a values against factors (except 1) of smallest b value, a % b == 0;
            Remove largest common factor discovered
            (ax) is now a factor
            Continue factoring until no powers remain, or it becomes unfactorable.
                Retrieve imaginary factors, or leave as unfactorable? Implement both?
        
        Return solution to user:
            Print results to user
            Ask if there are any more equations, then either restart or exit the program
 
 
 
    Ideas to implement in the future:
        Create a basic GUI to enter function / select options with
        Graph functions using a "Graph Now" button. Possibly move to real-time graphing later
        Include other types of equations:
            - Polynomial
            - Rational
            - Exponential
            - Logarithmic
            - Trigonometric
        Store values as a "history" to be accessed later
